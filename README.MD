# SearchNxt

A simple Electron.js application that indexes a selected folder and allows users to search through the files in that folder. This is a foundational tool that will be optimized and enhanced with additional features over time.

## Features

- **File Searching**: Enables users to search through the indexed files by name.

## Future Enhancements

The following improvements and features are planned for future releases:

- **Indexing Optimizations**: Improve indexing performance for large directories.

- **UI Enhancements**: Refine the user interface for a more polished and intuitive experience.
