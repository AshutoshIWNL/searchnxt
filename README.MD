# SearchNxt

A simple Electron.js application that indexes a selected folder and allows users to search through the files in that folder. This is a foundational tool that will be optimized and enhanced with additional features over time.

## Features

- **Directory Indexing**: Recursively scans and indexes all files within a selected folder, capturing details such as file name, size, and last modified date.
- **File Searching**: Enables users to search through the indexed files by name.

## Future Enhancements

The following improvements and features are planned for future releases:

- **Indexing Optimizations**: Improve indexing performance for large directories.
- **Advanced Search Capabilities**: Add more complex search options, such as filtering by file type, date range, and size.
- **Asynchronous Search**: Enhance the search mechanism to support real-time search as the user types.
- **Persistent Indexing**: Cache indexed data for faster reloading of previously scanned folders.
- **UI Enhancements**: Refine the user interface for a more polished and intuitive experience.
